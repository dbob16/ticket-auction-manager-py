# Ticket Auction Manager in Python
For now it has the following dependencies, since I haven't compiled from source:

* sqlalchemy, latest
* ttkbootstrap, latest

# Progress

* MainMenu (mostly complete)
* Ticket Forms (mostly complete)
* Basket Forms (mostly complete)
* Drawing Forms (mostly complete)
* Reports (**not** complete)
* Settings Forms (**not** complete)

So far this is **not** production ready at all. It's still in active development, I'm mainly posting it just to see if the community wants to help build this thing.

Pull Requests are now open!
